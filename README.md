Official Toby Bot repo

# Data:
Here is a list of things that might be saved by Toby Bot as well as how long it is saved for :
- Last 50 messages of every guild members [Saved in RAM, exported to the database in case of a punishement, exported in a channel when the command t!lastmessages is used]

# Todo:
- Implement t!lockdown  => Will work on it later, dont want to code this now, dont like playing with channels permissions, scary stuff yknow.

- Improve permissions so it works with temporary permission & it scans all at once for better efficiency.
                
- Auto Moderation Phase / Version 4. > Working on it
